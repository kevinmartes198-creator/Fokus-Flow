The previous AI engineer meticulously followed the system prompt, initiating with a thorough planning phase and seeking user confirmation for the proposed phased development. Their approach involved starting with a core foundation, then incrementally adding complex features like Stripe integration, internationalization, and a viral referral system. The engineer consistently utilized  for significant code changes and relied heavily on automated backend testing () after each major modification, proactively asking the user before proceeding with frontend tests. They demonstrated strong adherence to the provided design principles and critical rules, especially regarding URL management, environment variables, and third-party integrations (using  for Stripe). The engineer showed adaptability by incorporating user-requested features like multi-language support and social media sharing for referrals, maintaining clear communication throughout. The iterative feedback loop with testing and user confirmation was central to their successful delivery.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a To-do list application named FocusFlow with a focus timer (Pomodoro mode) and UI/UX gamification elements, potentially integrating with local storage or Firebase. The AI engineer proposed a comprehensive freemium model:
**Free Tier:** Basic Pomodoro (25/5), Task Management, Simple XP system, and Weekly rotating color themes.
**Premium Tier (Subscription):** Custom timer durations with sound selection, full gamification (XP levels, streaks, achievement badges, boosters), Cloud sync, Adaptive productivity-based themes, and a Deep Focus mode.
The user later requested adding internationalization (English, Spanish, French, German), an affiliate/referral system with a  instant payout for successful premium referrals, and extensive social media sharing (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok) for the referral links. The application uses a soft pastel color theme and adheres to specific design principles like rounded elements, hover effects, and purple gradients.

The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



- ****:
  - **Importance**: This file contains the core FastAPI application, defining all backend API endpoints and business logic. It handles user authentication, task management (CRUD), Pomodoro session tracking, gamification logic (XP, levels, achievements), Stripe webhook processing for subscriptions and referral commissions, and all database interactions.
  - **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to include user management, task/focus session endpoints, XP calculation, achievement unlocking, Stripe checkout session creation, subscription tier management, instant  referral commission payouts, and referral tracking/withdrawal APIs. It interacts with MongoDB via  from the environment.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main React component that renders the entire user interface. It contains all the UI logic, state management, and makes API calls to the backend. It dynamically renders different sections based on user interaction and subscription status.
  - **Changes Made**: Heavily modified to implement the main dashboard, task list, Pomodoro timer, gamification statistics, premium subscription modal, language switcher with multi-language support (English, Spanish, French, German), and the referral dashboard with social sharing options. It utilizes  for all backend communication.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Contains the global styling for the application, adhering to the specified design principles (soft pastel colors, purple theme, rounded elements, hover effects).
  - **Changes Made**: Updated to apply the mandated design system, including , gradient backgrounds, rounded corners (, , ), and the purple color scheme. New styles were added for the language switcher and the referral dashboard.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: This file serves as the record for testing protocols and summaries. It is frequently read and updated by the AI engineer to track the status of backend and frontend tests.
  - **Changes Made**: Continuously updated with summaries of backend and frontend test results, detailing the successful implementation of various features like gamification, Stripe payments, and the referral system.

<pending_tasks>
- **Phase 3 features** (from initial plan, not explicitly completed or re-requested):
    - Social sharing for achievements (social sharing for referral links is done).
    - Analytics dashboard.
    - Cloud sync functionality.
- **Projects/Kanban board** (from initial app description, not included in AI's plan summary).

<current_work>
The product, named FocusFlow, is a complete SaaS platform comprising a productivity app with task management, a Pomodoro timer, and a gamification system (XP, levels, achievements). It supports a premium subscription model (.99/month) integrated with Stripe for live payments, and features a viral  instant referral system allowing users to earn commissions and withdraw them directly. The application supports four languages (English, Spanish, French, German) and facilitates social sharing of referral links across six platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, WhatsApp).

The AI engineer has confirmed that the core features, premium subscription flow, multi-language support, and the referral system (including instant payouts and user-to-user testing) are 100% production-ready.

The immediate work being addressed is a user request to consolidate the application's layout. Specifically, the user wants the  referral earnings display to be prominently featured on the main page, preferably at the top, and the language switcher to be positioned aesthetically on the same main page. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this request and is preparing to implement these UI layout changes to improve visibility and user experience on the main screen.
