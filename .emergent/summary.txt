The previous AI engineer demonstrated a highly structured and iterative development process for the FocusFlow application. They began by confirming a phased development plan, ensuring user alignment before execution. Key characteristics of their work include consistent use of  for large code changes and diligent  after modifications, always seeking user confirmation for frontend testing. They rigorously adhered to URL management, environment variable rules, and leveraged  for Stripe. The engineer effectively incorporated evolving user requirements, such as multi-language support, a comprehensive EUR monetization strategy with in-app purchases and gamification, and advanced analytics. Problem-solving was evident through prompt identification and resolution of issues like the  component name mismatch and the , ensuring robust functionality. The work culminated in preparing the application for production deployment, showcasing a complete and refined product.

<product_requirements>
FocusFlow is a productivity application featuring task management and a Pomodoro timer, initially requested with gamification. The AI engineer proposed a freemium model: a free tier with basic timer, to-do, simple XP, and weekly themes; and a premium tier offering custom timers, full gamification (XP, levels, streaks, achievements, boosters), cloud sync, adaptive themes, and deep focus mode. User requests expanded to include internationalization (English, Spanish, French, German) and an affiliate/referral system with a  instant payout for premium referrals, integrated with extensive social media sharing. Design adheres to a soft pastel purple theme with rounded elements and hover effects. The application has evolved to support a multi-tier EUR pricing structure (€9.99/month, €89.99/year, €199.99 one-time lifetime deal), in-app purchases (€2-5 for XP boosters, theme packs, streak savers), and enhanced gamification features like badges, progress bars, and ghosted premium features to encourage upgrades without forced conversions. Legacy USD premium users are recognized with a Legacy Premium badge.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Contains the core FastAPI application logic, including API endpoints for user authentication, task/focus management, gamification (XP, levels, achievements, daily challenges), Stripe integration for subscriptions and referrals, and new in-app purchase systems.
  - **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to implement multi-tier EUR pricing (), update  enum, adjust subscription checkout, add  field to  model, introduce  helper. New models (, , ) and their helper functions/API endpoints were added. Badge and ghosted feature APIs, as well as daily challenges endpoints, were implemented. Recent changes include comprehensive error handling, input validation, and security middleware for production readiness.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main React component rendering the UI and handling state/API calls.
  - **Changes Made**: Modified for the main dashboard, task list, Pomodoro timer, gamification stats, premium subscription modal, language switcher, and referral dashboard. Recent changes include:
    *   Creation of a  component and its integration.
    *   Repositioning and consolidation of the .
    *   Refactoring and correct referencing of .
    *   Updates to the  to display new EUR pricing tiers and handle package selections.
    *   Introduction of  helper function for consistent premium checks.
    *   Implementation of the  component for in-app purchases.
    *   Creation and integration of the  for gamification.
    *   Implementation of the  for productivity insights.
    *   Logic for displaying Legacy Premium and other tier-specific badges.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Defines the global and component-specific styling, adhering to the specified design principles.
  - **Changes Made**: Updated to support the mandated design system. New styles were added for the , the revamped subscription modal, new premium badge types (e.g., gold, green, animated), the new  component, and the .

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Serves as the primary record for testing protocols, user problem statements, and summaries of test results.
  - **Changes Made**: Continuously updated after each major feature implementation (UI layout, EUR pricing, in-app purchases, gamification, analytics) to reflect successful backend and frontend test outcomes, including specific bug fixes.

- **New Production-related files (, , , , )**:
  - **Importance**: These files are crucial for configuring and deploying the application in a production environment, separating production settings from development, and enabling robust deployment strategies.
  - **Changes Made**: Created to set up a production environment, define Docker build processes for both frontend and backend, provide scripts for starting services in production, and include a basic health check script.

<current_work>
The FocusFlow application is a fully developed SaaS platform offering task management, a Pomodoro timer, and a comprehensive gamification system. It operates on a freemium model, with a robust premium subscription system now fully migrated to multi-tier EUR pricing (€9.99/month, €89.99/year, €199.99 lifetime) via Stripe. A viral referral system with tiered instant payouts (€5/€15/€25) and social sharing is fully functional. The application supports four languages (English, Spanish, French, German).

Significant recent work includes:
1.  **UI Layout Consolidation**: The  referral earnings display has been prominently moved to a new top banner on the main page, and the language switcher has been aesthetically repositioned within this banner. Duplicated elements were removed, and the dashboard layout was streamlined.
2.  **EUR Pricing System (Phase 1)**: All subscription tiers (Monthly, Yearly, Lifetime) are implemented with EUR pricing in the backend and reflected in a redesigned, multi-package subscription modal on the frontend. Legacy premium users are gracefully handled with a Legacy Premium badge.
3.  **In-App Purchases & Creative Enhancements (Phase 2)**: A complete in-app shop system with six products (e.g., XP Boosters, Theme Packs, Streak Savers) and associated Stripe payment flow is integrated. A Daily Challenges system offers smart, engagement-based discounts and rewards.
4.  **Advanced Gamification (Phase 3)**: A sophisticated badge system (19 badges across 6 categories with tiers and rarity levels), Ghosted Features for free users to preview premium functionality, and the Daily Challenges system are fully integrated, providing a rich gamified experience.
5.  **Advanced Features (Phase 4)**: A comprehensive Analytics Dashboard with productivity scores, focus patterns analysis, social sharing capabilities for achievements/progress, and cloud sync with multi-device support have been implemented.

The AI engineer has now initiated **Production Deployment** preparations. This includes adding backend security measures (error handling, input validation, middleware) and creating essential production infrastructure files such as , , and production start scripts (, ), along with a  script. The last action was creating additional monitoring and logging files for production.
